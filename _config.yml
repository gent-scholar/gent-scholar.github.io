          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          In 1964, founder J.R. “Dick” Sargent created a Department with the first few professors and graduate students. He envisioned a department that would use, and train its students to use, the critical mathematical tools needed for analysis of complex economic issues – a legacy that continues to the present day.

          During my time at Warwick I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.
          I spent my free time as establishing and leading the student society *Rethink Economics Warwick* of *Rethinking Economics International* on roles such as *External Relations Officer* and *Co-ordinator* organising many academic talks and panel discussions.
